            and are at risk of falling behind in their academic and
            social-emotional development without timely intervention by Speech
            and Language Pathologists (SLPs). Unfortunately, there is a
            significant shortage of SLPs and the COVID pandemic has further
            exacerbated this gap, making it almost impossible for SLPs to
            provide individualized services for children.

              The NSF and IES AI Institute for Transforming Education for
              Children with Speech and Language Processing Challenges
            </b>
            &nbsp;(<b>or National AI Institute for Exceptional Education,</b> in
            short) aims to close this gap by developing advanced AI technologies
            to scale SLPs' availability and services such that no child in need
            of speech and language services is left behind. Towards this end,
            the Institute proposes to develop two novel AI solutions: (1)
            the&nbsp;<b>AI Screener</b> to enable universal early screening for
            all children, and (2) the
            <b>
              <i>&nbsp;</i>AI Orchestrator
            </b>{" "}
            to work with SLPs and teachers to provide individualized
            interventions for children with their formal Individualized
            Education Program (IEP).&nbsp; In developing these solutions, the
            Institute will advance foundational AI technologies, enhance our
            understanding of children's speech and language development, serve
            as a nexus point for all special education stakeholders, and
            represent a fundamental paradigm shift in how SLPs serve children in
            need of ability-based speech and language services.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Institute's research will lead to advancements in AI, human-AI
            interaction, and learning science to improve educational outcomes
            for children with speech and language related challenges. These
            advancements and solutions can&nbsp;also benefit children without
            disabilities extending the reach of ability-based learning
            interventions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute will engage participants
            across the Institute and related stakeholders to advance&nbsp;
